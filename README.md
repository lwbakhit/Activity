### **Stripe Case Report**

#### *Background*
+ Stripe provides plug-and-play API’s to manage the (rather complex) processing of making and receiving payments on a website, most notably via credit card. Stripe’s API’s support refunds, fraud prevention, recurring payments, and various monitoring tools. It has branched out to support in-person payments, the issuance of proprietary payment cards. It even provides a turn-key solution for setting up an internet business.

#### *Competitive Advantage*
+ Stripe utilizes technology to their advantage by allowing anybody to set-up payment platforms to help facilitate transactions for their business. Also, Stripe has turn key applications built that can set certain customers up with payments software seamlessly. They are considered a FinTech company since they are building applications and solutions outside of traditional financial mechanisms to assist clients with their payment needs.

#### *Strengths & Weaknesses*
+ By creating a secure platform for payments direct from consumer to company, Stripe brings a pivotal system to the FinTech space allowing companies to take advantage of their systems. Their strong suit is the ability to provide direct payments with a secure system that protects the consumers' banking details making a relatively simple system for the end user. 

#### *Future Prognosis*
+ Stripe is growing at a fast rate, not only being easy for the everyday consumer, but also allowing more and more companies to easily access normally advanced systems. The company expects to continue to become the leading payment system for companies around the world, whether small or big.
