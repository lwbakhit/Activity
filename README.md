Stripe provides plug-and-play API’s to manage the (rather complex) processing of making and receiving payments on a website, most notably via credit card. Stripe’s API’s support refunds, fraud prevention, recurring payments, and various monitoring tools. It has branched out to support in-person payments, the issuance of proprietary payment cards. It even provides a turn-key solution for setting up an internet business.

Stripe utilizes technology to their advantage by allowing anybody to set-up payment platforms to help facilitate transactions for their business. Also, Stripe has turn key applications built that can set certain customers up with payments software seamlessly. They are considered a Fintech since they are building applications and solutions outside of traditional financial mechanisms to assist clients with their payment needs.
